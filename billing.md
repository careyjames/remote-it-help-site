# Billing Rates & Policies ðŸ’³

We believe in transparent and straightforward pricing for our remote IT support services.

## Project-Based Work

For larger projects like email migrations or complex DNS/DMARC setups, we can provide a detailed quote with a fixed price or a "not-to-exceed" estimate. Please contact us to discuss your specific project needs.

## Payment Information
