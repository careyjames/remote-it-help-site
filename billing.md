## Business Ethics: Carey‚Äôs Promise üßë‚Äçüî¨

As the Founder of IT Help San Diego Inc., I see my role as a scientist, not a salesperson. My recommendations are based on transparent, verifiable data, not opinions or distributor deals. <strong class="ethics-statement">We don‚Äôt sell products, and we don‚Äôt accept commissions, affiliate fees, or kickbacks.</strong> If we recommend a solution, whether it's Cloudflare, SentinelOne, or 1Password, it's because we believe it's the best tool for the job. We'll show you the options, explain the *why*, and you'll typically purchase directly from the vendor. Our only revenue comes from our time and expertise dedicated to implementing these solutions effectively for you. My focus is always on your long-term reliability‚Äîtruly listening so I can help you understand exactly what you want‚Äîand delivering real value.
