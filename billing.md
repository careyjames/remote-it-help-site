# Remote Consulting Rates & Policies 💳

We follow clear policies for our remote IT support services. No monthly retainers!

## Remote Support Rate

* **Base Rate:** $275 per hour.
* **Minimum Charge:** There is a **30-minute minimum** charge for all remote/phone support sessions.
* **Billing Increments:** After the 30-minute minimum, we bill precisely in **1-minute increments**, based on call/session timers or time tracked for offline tasks.

## Payment Policy

* **Method:** We require a valid credit card on file before services are rendered.
* **Billing Cycle:** Billing occurs automatically **at the end of each session or day's work** to the authorized card on file.
* **Terms:** We do not accept checks or offer net payment terms. **No card, no service—no exceptions.**

## Scheduling & Cancellation Policy

* **Booking:** Appointments are booked with a 30-minute minimum charge (deposit) for remote sessions, which reserves that time specifically for you.
* **Billing:** You are only billed for the time used beyond the initial 30-minute minimum.
* **Notice:** To reschedule or cancel without charge, please provide at least **24 hours’ notice**.
* **Late/No-Show:** Late cancellations (less than 24 hours) or no-shows will be billed for the 30-minute minimum, as that time was held exclusively for you.

## Quick Phone/Text/Email Support

* Existing clients are welcome to reach out anytime.
* We do not charge for brief communications (under 10 minutes).

## Business Ethics: Carey’s Promise 🧑‍🔬

As the Founder of IT Help San Diego Inc., I see my role as a scientist, not a salesperson. My recommendations are based on transparent, verifiable data, not opinions or distributor deals. <strong class="ethics-statement">We don’t sell products, and we don’t accept commissions, affiliate fees, or kickbacks.</strong> If we recommend a solution, whether it's Route 53, SentinelOne, or 1Password, it's because we believe it's the best tool for the job. We'll show you the options, explain the *why*, and you'll typically purchase directly from the vendor. Our only revenue comes from our time and expertise dedicated to implementing these solutions effectively for you. My focus is always on your long-term reliability—truly listening so I can help you understand exactly what you want—and delivering real value.
