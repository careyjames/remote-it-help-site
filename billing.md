# Remote Consulting Rates & Policies 💳

We follow clear policies for our remote IT support services.

## Remote Support Rate

* **Base Rate:** $275 per hour.
* **Minimum Charge:** There is a 30-minute minimum charge for all remote/phone support sessions.
* **Billing Increments:** After the 30-minute minimum, we bill in 15-minute increments.

## Payment Policy

* **Terms:** We do not accept checks or offer net payment terms. **No card, no service—no exceptions.**

## Scheduling & Cancellation Policy

* **Booking:** Appointments are booked with a 30-minute minimum charge (deposit) for remote sessions, which reserves that time specifically for you.
* **Billing:** You are only billed for the time used beyond the initial 30-minute minimum.
* **Notice:** To reschedule or cancel without charge, please provide at least **24 hours’ notice**.
* **Late/No-Show:** Late cancellations (less than 24 hours) or no-shows will be billed for the 30-minute minimum, as that time was held exclusively for you.

## Quick Phone/Text/Email Support

* We have served high-profile, sensitive security and entertainment businesses for 25 years.
* We have never had a data leak. Your trust is paramount.

## Business Ethics: Carey’s Promise 🧑‍🔬

As the Founder of IT Help San Diego Inc., I see my role as a scientist, not a salesperson. My recommendations are based on transparent, verifiable data, not opinions or distributor deals. That’s why we don’t sell any products—only our time. You’ll never see me push hardware for an affiliate fee. Instead, I show you the raw specs so you can make the best choice for your needs. My focus is always on your long-term reliability—truly listening so I can help you understand exactly what you want—and delivering real value. I’ve always stayed true to my ethics: no price gouging, no hidden fees, and no cutting corners on quality.
