In my [IT consulting work](/services.html), my PhD clients have always told me that I naturally follow a process like the scientific method when solving complex technical problems. I may not wear a lab coat, but the way I tackle IT issues is essentially scientific. By approaching problems in a structured, evidence-based way (aligning with [my commitment to ethical service](/about.html)), I ensure that solutions are reliable and not just based on hunches. Below, I explain how each stage of the classic scientific method translates into my IT troubleshooting approach, with a few personal tweaks for the consulting world.

### 1. Observation

I always start by observing and listening. That means I watch the client demonstrate the problem in their environment and ask plenty of clarifying questions. The goal is to deeply understand the technical symptoms and the client’s underlying goals and concerns. This careful observation ensures I tackle the right problem and sets a strong foundation for everything.

### 2. Research

Once I have a clear picture of the issue, the next step is research. I seek authoritative sources—official documentation, vendor knowledge bases, perhaps even academic papers like the RFCs—to gather definitive information about the problem domain. By doing my homework, I avoid guesswork and make sure any potential solution is grounded in facts. It’s like reviewing the scientific literature before experimenting: it ensures I build on solid, proven knowledge.

### 3. Hypothesis

I then form a hypothesis about the root cause with observations and research. In other words, I come up with a concise explanation of what I think is going wrong and why. Just as necessary, I communicate this understanding to the client in clear, jargon-free terms. Sharing my hypothesis shows the client my thought process and invites their input, confirming we’re on the same page before moving forward.

### 4. Experimentation

With a hypothesis in hand, it’s time for experimentation. I try out the most promising solution—ideally one supported by official documentation or prior evidence—in a safe, controlled environment. Crucially, I always inform the client about what I plan to do and any potential risks or side effects before making changes. This ethical transparency builds trust and ensures that we handle the fix methodically, with no unpleasant surprises.

### 5. Analysis

As I test, I gather and analyze evidence at every step. This means collecting logs, error messages, performance metrics, or screenshots documenting exactly what’s happening. Analyzing this data tells me whether the changes have the expected effect or if a new strategy is needed. These artifacts also come in handy if I need to consult with fellow professionals—concrete evidence makes collaboration and further troubleshooting much more effective.

### 6. Conclusion

After experimentation, I conclude and implement the solution. I make sure to verify that the issue is truly resolved, not just patched up. Then, I present the outcome to the client, backed by the evidence gathered, showing logs or a before-and-after comparison to prove the fix worked. By providing solid proof rather than just an opinion, I ensure the client has confidence that the problem was addressed definitively and the root cause understood.

### 7. Communication

The final step in my process is communication of what I’ve learned. I take time to document the entire journey and its resolution, often writing up the insights in a [blog post like this](/blog.html). Publishing these findings turns a one-off fix into a reusable guide and helps establish my authority on the topic. In essence, I’m closing the loop of the scientific method by sharing results, which benefits the broader IT community and reinforces a culture of evidence-based problem-solving.
