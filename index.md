We listen closely and implement solutions that are proven to work effectively, tailored to your specific needs.

## Core Remote Expertise

While we can tackle a vast array of IT challenges remotely, our key areas of deep expertise include:

### Advanced Email, Domain, & DNS Solutions 🌐
Struggling with email deliverability, domain security, or complex DNS configurations? We ensure these critical systems run flawlessly, helping you migrate to modern platforms like Google Workspace (and escape legacy systems like Exchange!), so you can focus on your business.

* **Bulletproof DNS & DMARC Security**: We architect security-compliant DNS solutions with robust DMARC implementations (p=reject), moving beyond <span class="dmarc-tag">p=none</span> to actively protect your domain from spoofing and phishing attacks.

### Remote Cybersecurity & Ethical Screen Sharing 🛡️
We provide robust remote defenses against viruses, email phishing, browser blocks, and more, providing powerful tools to reduce risks and enhance your digital security. We can help secure your endpoints (macOS, Windows, Linux) and advise on best practices for mobile device security.
* **Ethical Screen Sharing:** We adhere to the highest ethical standards. For all screen-sharing sessions, **you, the client, always initiate and approve access**. We never access your systems "behind your back."
