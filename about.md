# About Carey Balboa üßë‚Äçüî¨

Hi, I‚Äôm Carey Balboa.
*(Carey: Like the Hawksbill Sea Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) Common Name: Carey)*
*(Balboa: Like Balboa Park in San Diego)*

I‚Äôve been solving tech problems for 25 years. I love a challenge, solving technical problems, and helping people. I‚Äôm committed to mission success, and scientific discovery is my passion. Since 1999, I‚Äôve assisted high-profile clients in the entertainment, medical, and legal sectors, as well as PhDs in medicine, with their technology challenges.

## Business Ethics: Carey‚Äôs Promise

As the Founder of IT Help San Diego Inc., I see my role as a scientist, not a salesperson. My recommendations are based on transparent, verifiable data, not opinions or distributor deals. <strong class="ethics-statement">We don‚Äôt sell products, and we don‚Äôt accept commissions, affiliate fees, or kickbacks.</strong> If we recommend a solution, whether it's Route 53, SentinelOne, or 1Password, it's because we believe it's the best tool for the job. We'll show you the options, explain the *why*, and you'll typically purchase directly from the vendor. Our only revenue comes from our time and expertise dedicated to implementing these solutions effectively for you. My focus is always on your long-term reliability‚Äîtruly listening so I can help you understand exactly what you want‚Äîand delivering real value.

I‚Äôve always stayed true to my ethics: no price gouging, no hidden fees, and no cutting corners on quality. That‚Äôs who I am, and that‚Äôs exactly how I‚Äôll continue to operate.
