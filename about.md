# About Carey Balboa 🧑‍🔬

![Carey Balboa, Founder of Remote IT Help, with his service animal Tango.](/assets/images/carey-balboa.jpeg){: width="200" loading="lazy" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" }

Hi, I’m Carey Balboa.
*(Carey: Like the Hawksbill Sea Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) Common Name: Carey)*
*(Balboa: Like Balboa Park in San Diego)*

I’ve been solving tech problems for 25 years. I love a challenge, solving technical problems, and helping people. I’m committed to mission success, and scientific discovery is my passion. Since 1999, I’ve assisted high-profile clients in the entertainment, medical, and legal sectors, as well as PhDs in medicine, with their technology challenges.

## Business Ethics: Carey’s Promise

As the Founder of IT Help San Diego Inc., I see my role as a scientist, not a salesperson. My recommendations are based on transparent, verifiable data, not opinions or distributor deals. <strong class="ethics-statement">We don’t sell products, and we don’t accept commissions, affiliate fees, or kickbacks.</strong> If we recommend a solution, whether it's Route 53, SentinelOne, or 1Password, it's because we believe it's the best tool for the job. We'll show you the options, explain the *why*, and you'll typically purchase directly from the vendor. Our only revenue comes from our time and expertise dedicated to implementing these solutions effectively for you. My focus is always on your long-term reliability—truly listening so I can help you understand exactly what you want—and delivering real value.

I’ve always stayed true to my ethics: no price gouging, no hidden fees, and no cutting corners on quality. That’s who I am, and that’s exactly how I’ll continue to operate.
