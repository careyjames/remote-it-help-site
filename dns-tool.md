# DNS Tool üõ†Ô∏è - My Command-Line DNS Auditor

Tired of juggling a dozen different web tools and `dig` commands just to check if a domain's DNS and email security records were *actually* set up right? **So was I.** That's why I built **DNS Tool**.

### Why I Built This: The `p=none` Problem

As I always say: **‚ÄúIf your DMARC says `p=none`, your work‚Äôs not done‚Äîget to `p=reject`!‚Äù**

But getting to `p=reject` isn't just about DMARC. It means ensuring SPF is aligned, DKIM is signing correctly, DNSSEC is enabled, and MTA-STS is in place. Before DNS Tool, verifying all this meant a tedious dance across countless browser tabs and terminal windows, especially when waiting for DNS propagation. It was inefficient and far too easy to miss something critical.

### One Tool to Check Them All (The Nerd Brag Part)

DNS Tool is my personal command-line solution born from that frustration. It‚Äôs a single, portable binary (thanks to PyInstaller!) that runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows ‚Äì no Python install needed on the target system. It's my Swiss Army knife for DNS validation.

In one go, it hammers a domain and reports back, with clear ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è symbols, on *all* the important stuff:

* **Core Records:** NS, A, AAAA, MX, TXT, SOA, CAA
* **Email Security:** SPF (and its lookups!), DMARC (with `p=reject` nagging!), multiple DKIM selectors, MTA-STS, BIMI
* **Infrastructure:** DNSSEC validation status
* **Info:** PTR records and even an RDAP/WHOIS lookup.

It works interactively (with history!) or in batch mode. I use it daily to get a quick, comprehensive picture of a domain's DNS health, verify changes *instantly* as they propagate, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. It saves me time and gives me confidence that things are *really* secure and configured correctly.
